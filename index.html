        <p>Professional pet services for all domestic animals.</p>
        <p>We love pets and know just how hard it can be to provide them with all of the care and time they need when we lead busy lives ourselves. Pawsitive Choice can offer professional dog walking, puppy care, pet sitting and pet taxi services to ensure that you can provide your pets with the full and happy life they deserve.</p>

        <p>We are based in Finaghy, Belfast and largely cover Finaghy, the Lisburn Rd, Dunmurry and surrounding areas. We have always had a passion for animals and have had many pets over the years from rodents, birds, tropical fish, cats and dogs. We have fostered and volunteered on behalf of Assisi animal sanctuary. Over the years we have rescued and rehomed a number of animals. At present we have 3 cats and 1 dog and our family wouldn't be complete without them.</p>
